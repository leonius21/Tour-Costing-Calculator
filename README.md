# Tour Costing Calculator

*   **Data Persistence:** Tour data is saved locally using Room for future reference, allowing users to pick up where they left off.

## Technologies Used (or may be used)

*   **Kotlin:** The primary programming language for Android development.
*   **Android SDK:** The official SDK for building Android applications.
*   **Jetpack Compose:** A modern UI toolkit for building native Android UIs.
